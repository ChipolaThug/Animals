# Animals
Tangible interaction to learn Animals name in other langages

Hello there, we're creating an web application with a friend for a course project.
We wanted to use tangible interaction with a kid application, to help them learn the name of animals.
You can access the app here : <a href="https://chipolathug.github.io/Animals/tangible_project/menu.html">App</a>

To use this application, you will need a tangible object which consist of an isosceles triangle which represents
an animal.
